            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We are a diverse team of guitar instructors representing a wire array of genres. What do we have in common? Our love for the instrument and our boundary-pushing approach to teaching the instrument. From Muhammed Suicmez to Ana Vidovic or blues to pop, we have the best of the best and bring them right to you.

            <h3>We Have the Best Instructors</h3>
            <p>
                The pedigree simply doesn't get any pedigreer (is that even a word?). Our guitarist have chops, and they know how to cook up and serve them so that you can also have chops (yum).
            </p>
            <h3>We Bring Them Right to You</h3>
            <p>
                You probably can't fly hundreds of miles for every lesson--well don't worry! We bring our qualified instructors right to you with technology. Why not start a garage band with John Mayer tomorrow?
